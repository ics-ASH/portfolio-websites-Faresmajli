<p>IOT - IoT devices are pieces of hardware, such as sensors, actuators, gadgets, appliances, or machines, that are programmed for certain applications and can transmit data over the internet or other networks. </p>
<p> Smart thermostats have been available for over ten years. A thermostat is considered "smart" if it can connect to WiFi or Z-Wave. Smart thermostats range from simple models to more complicated high-end ones like Google Nest and Ecobee, they can learn your habits to save energy and keep your home at a good temperature. Smart thermostats can save money by turning off heating and cooling when not needed. The Environmental Protection Agency found that Energy Star smart thermostats save users an average of 8% on utility bills, around $50 per year, though savings may be higher in extreme climates or areas with high energy prices. A way smart thermostats save energy is by detecting when nobody is home using motion sensors or phone location. They switch to energy-saving modes automatically. Smart thermostats also make it easy to set heating and cooling schedules, like turning down the system at night or when the house is empty during the day. “Setting your thermostat back 7° to 10° F for 8 hours a day can save up to 10% on energy bills”, according to the Department of Energy. Smart thermostats are easier to program than normal thermostats, making buying more convenient. High-end smart thermostats can learn your schedule and adjust on their own. They also offer features like system usage reports, energy-saving tips, and reminders to replace HVAC filters. Some can connect to utility programs for additional savings. Even without advanced features, you can turn off your thermostat from an app, saving energy if you forget before leaving on a trip and making them reliable and super convenient. </p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
<p>Blockchain - Crypto</p>
<p>A blockchain is a database or ledger that is shared within computer network nodes. They have a huge role in cryptocurrency which maintains secure and dispersed records of transactions made. Blockchains can also be used for making data (any industry) immutable. There is no way around changing a block, the only trust that is needed is where a user or program enters data. This all reduces the requirement of trust from third parties, who are normally auditors or people who add cost and make mistakes. A blockchain is similar to a spreadsheet or database. A blockchain like a database holds the information that is entered. The difference is how the data is shown, structured and read. A blockchain is made up of programs called scripts that do the work for you. When a blockchain is distributed it means that any copies are automatically saved on machines. The transaction process is specific, it will vary based on what the blockchain is taking place on. If we look at Bitcoin’s blockchain, when initiating a transaction using cryptocurrency money, it triggers a set of events to follow. When using Bitcoin, the transaction that is made gets sent to a pool that stores and holds the memory of everything. Then the transaction gets put into a queue until a validator picks it up. Then, entered into a block and the block fills up with transactions it gets closed and coded using their encryption algorithm. </p>
    
<p>Robotics</p>
<p>Robotics is a branch of engineering focused on designing, building, and operating robots, which are machines that perform tasks typically done by humans. These robots do not have to look like people, though some are designed to appear human to make people feel more comfortable around them, even if some find them creepy. Robots come in many forms and serve various functions in different industries. There are many types of robots, each tailored to specific tasks. In healthcare, robots assist in surgeries, help with physical therapy, and deliver supplies in hospitals. Home robots, like the Roomba, clean and can perform other household tasks. In manufacturing, robots handle tasks such as welding and packaging. Logistics robots manage warehouse operations and deliveries, while space exploration robots, like those on Mars, explore distant worlds. The military uses robots for dangerous jobs, such as bomb disposal and carrying equipment. Robots also serve in entertainment, travel, and more, with advancements continuously expanding their roles and capabilities. There are advantages and disadvantages, such as the ability to work in hazardous environments, robotics increase productivity, and they also ensure a better quality of work. Robots can repetitively perform tasks mistakeless while not losing boredom. The disadvantages, robotics requires an excessive amount of money just as a startup costs, robots will start to take away jobs and robots also need companies to hire more skilled staff to be able to control and program the robot. Robots require programmers, operators, and repair personnel making it a big cost and a lot of work.</p>
